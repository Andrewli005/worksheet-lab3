## HELLO! Clone Instructions

This is the README file for the worksheet part of lab. 

To clone it to your local machine using Positron, follow these steps:


### Step 1: Open Positron

Once you have Positron installed on your machine, open it up.

### Step 2: Navigate to the top of your screen:

- Select File > New Folder from Git

- If the `New Folder from Git` option is not available, you will need to navigate to the **`Source Control`** panel on the right side of the positron interface (it looks like a branching tree icon). Click on it, and then click trust project / authorize.

- You may also be prompted to sign in to GitHub. The sign-in process will open a new browser window. Follow the prompts to authorize Positron to access your GitHub account. The process is more straightforward in Positron than in the terminal.

- If you are still having trouble with this step, raise your hand for help!

### Step 3: Clone the repository

- In the dialog box that appears, enter the following URL:

> https://github.com/berkeley-stat133/worksheet-lab3

- Then select your desired location to save (preferably your `stat133` folder).

### Step 4: Open the worksheet.qmd file and start working!


### Alternative (Not Recommended): Cloning via Terminal

If you are still having trouble, you can always clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cd path/to/your/stat133/folder
git clone https://github.com/berkeley-stat133/worksheet-lab3
```
